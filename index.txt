Translation by Vincent ISAMBART

h1. Ruby Hacking Guide

This is the home page of the project to translate in English the "Ruby
Hacking Guide":http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/. The RHG is a book
that explains how internally works the ruby interpreter (the official
C implementation of the "Ruby language":http://www.ruby-lang.org/).

To fully understand it, you need a good knowledge of C and Ruby. The
original book includes a Ruby tutorial (chapter 1), but it has not
been translated yet, and I think there are more important chapters to
translate first. So if you have not done it yet, you should read a
book like the "Pickaxe":http://www.rubycentral.com/book/ before.

This translation is done during my free time to improve my Japanese
and my knowledge of Ruby, and English is not my native tongue, do not
expect too much. The book is quite big (more than 500 pages) so I
doubt I will be able to translate it fully by myself. I need help!

People who are good in Ruby, C and Japanese or English are
needed. Those good in Japanese (native Japanese speakers are of course
welcome) can help translate and those good in English (preferably
native speakers) can help correct mistakes, rewrite badly written
parts... Knowing Ruby and C well is really a requirement because it
helps avoiding many mistranslations and misinterpretations.

People good at making diagrams would also be useful because there are
quite a lot to redo and translators should rather spend their time
translating instead of making diagrams.

So if you want to help us, join the "rhg-discussion mailing
list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/rhg-discussion and
introduce yourself (who you are, your skills, how much free time you
have). You can of course just join the mailing list to see what's
going on. And do not hesitate to ask questions!

Please note that this book was based on the source code of ruby 1.7.3
so there are a few small differences with the current version of
ruby. However, these differences may make the source code simpler to
understand and the Ruby Hacking Guide is a good starting point before
looking into the ruby source code. The version of the source code used
can be downloaded there: http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.tar.gz.

The RubyForge project page is http://rubyforge.org/projects/rhg.

Many thanks to "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org for hosting us and to
Minero AOKI to let us translate his work.
